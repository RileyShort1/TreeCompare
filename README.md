# TreeCompare
AVL vs. Splay Tree comparison 

This project is a comparison between an AVL tree and a Splay Tree which will serve as a benchmark of performance for both. 
The trees will be compared in regard to their time and space complexity in the hopes that the raw data will be useful to  
any programers or computer science students who use such data structures.
