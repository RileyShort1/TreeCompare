AVL vs. Splay Tree comparison 

This project is a comparison between an AVL tree and a Splay Tree which will serve as a benchmark of performance for both. 
The trees will be compared regarding their time and space complexity in the context of uniform vs. Gaussian data distribution. We hope that the raw data will be useful to any programmers or computer science students who use such data structures. [link to google doc here when ready]
